# ChatApp in Go (Archived Version)

This was my first attempt at building a chat application in Go, based on a YouTube tutorial.
While I gained foundational understanding through this, I later realized the architecture did not align with my learning goals.

### ⚠️ Project Archived

I have since restarted the project from scratch with a new direction, building a CLI-based version where I’m adding more features and writing cleaner, self-understood code.

👉 The newer version is available here: (https://github.com/faizanfirdousi/go-cli-chat)

### Why I’m keeping this repo:
- To preserve learning history
- To maintain commit consistency
- To document the evolution of the project
